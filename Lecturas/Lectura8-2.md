## See What You Want to See: Visual User-Driven Approach for Hybrid Recommendation

### Resumen

The authors study how the aspects of the interface and user characteristics and how this affects the user experience using the recommender system. They explore how the user controllability affects their experience with hybrid systems and how the user controlling the fusion process between the several sources of recommendation is, in general better than a "black box" approach.

Then, they show several previous user interfaces and explain in a quick manner what they do, their pros and cons and how they based some of their work in previous user interfaces.

Afterwards, they propose a user interface that is used to recommend conference meetings to people based on different sources such as information about the talk, people and users personal information that is collected. They show their user interface and how this shows where the recommendation is coming from, and how you can adjust certain values to give you different recommendation weighing the different sources.

Later, they show how the recommender algorithm is used, what parameters they used and how they optimized them. Then, they showed how they performed different user studies and a quick summary of the results they got (they also included a reference to the full results).

### Cr√≠tica

In this paper they show an interesting idea of how a user interface can improve conference recommendations, they make an clear, fun and easy interface to interact that makes it easier and more entertaining way of searching for conference talks.

I like how they performed and showed the statistical analysis made on the survey more specifically how they shoed the t-test and their results. This gives more confidence in their results.

They could've mentioned different applications for their interface, like how it can be used in a different context rather than conference meetings. Also in some contexts having more options and freedom of choice actually makes us unhappier [1].
