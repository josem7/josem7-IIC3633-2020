overlappedrecommendation### Inspectability and Control in Social Recommenders

## Resumen
In this paper the authors tackle the idea that giving users grater inspectability and control over social recommender (recommender systems based on your social network) increases the user's perception of the recommender system.

First they start by describing the different criteria they use like inspectability, control, social recommender systems, etc. and the previous works that have been done exploring the impact of this areas in recommender systems.

Then they explain how the system works. It works by assigning weights for each friend based on the amount of likes overlapped between them, they use Pearson’s correlation coefficient to achieve this. Then they compute the recommendation and offer the user the ability to interact with sliders to adjust the weights and by consequence the recommendations.

They did an experiment based on 267 participants, were they asked the participants questions before the control stage. This stage consisted of assigning the participants to one of three categories, these were no control, item control and friend control where they could adjust the sliders. Finally, they inspected the recommendations and were asked to respond a final questionnaire.

Finally, they show their results and with them they argue why social recommender systems benefit from having tools that increases the user's inspectability and control over the system.

## Crítica

I'm not sure I 100% agree on the idea that friends that recommendations are based on should be rated or weighted. This is because we as human beings may have a bias on weighing friends based on our social relation rather than taste on preference in a subject like music. This could lead to the user having less diversity on their choices and less novelty.

The number of participants is not that great though I like the idea of including a summary of the group characteristics, so we have a better understanding of them. It would be good if they could show some personality traits as well to have a further understanding of the results.

This paper explore an interesting area and show clearly their results and arguments. I personally don't feel entirely convinced that grater inspectability and control benefit the users experience using the recommender system. I say this because the grater satisfaction in this case could not be due to better recommendations but due to people wanting to perceive the recommendations that they helped create as better than they actually are. Most of the time people don't know what they really want and a great strength in recommender systems is to find this novelty.
