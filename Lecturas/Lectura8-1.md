## A User-Centric Evaluation Framework of Recommender Systems

### Resumen
In this paper the authors aim to create a comprehensive to evaluate perceived qualities of recommender systems, they call this model ResQue. ResQue consists of 16 constructs and a total of 60 question items. It is divided in four main areas which are the perceived system qualities, users beliefs as a result of these qualities, their subjective attitudes, and their behavioral intentions.

Afterwards they show some of the previous work made on how to evaluate the systems from the users point of view, and how they build from this ideas. Then, they show their previous work on creating a model, exposing how they can enhance their creations based on their work, critics of their work and other peoples work.

Then, they explain in more detail the different main areas and their subsequent divisions in sub areas and what they mean. They also justify why this criteria were chosen and why some were not.

finally, they show how they came up with a simplified model and why this model can be useful in some cases like doing a quick and useful evaluation.


### Cr√≠tica

I find the idea of creating a well balanced framework to evaluate recommender systems a good and useful idea. This framework eases the work of designers and researchers to evaluate recommender systems as well as making a baseline on how recommender systems should be evaluated.

They make a good job justifying their choices based of previous work, showing clearly some of the previous work done on evaluating this systems from the users point of view.

The fact that they show all the previous work done by them and other people on the subject and how they build on top of previous ideas creates a better sense of trust in this current model they are developing.

When explaining the sub-areas of the model they make it very easy to understand as well as a good job justifying why they choose them as well as justifying in some cases why they preferred that specific term instead of another.

It would be interesting if instead of using previous work done on the area and justifying their results through empirical works, they also incorporate knowledge form other areas such as psychology.

In conclusion this is a well written paper, their ideas and decisions are well justified and the topic is very useful to the area of recommender systems. As a final thought it would be good to have an open channel so everyone can asses the questionnaire and propose ideas on how it can be improved, this would further validate their work.
